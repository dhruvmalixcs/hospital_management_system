## Introduction

The Hospital Management System is designed to help manage hospital operations. It allows users to add and view patients, view doctors, and book appointments. This project utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and JDBC for database operations.

## Features

- **Add Patient:** Add new patients to the hospital database.
- **View Patients:** Display a list of all patients.
- **View Doctors:** Display a list of all doctors.
- **Book Appointment:** Schedule an appointment with a doctor.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/HospitalManagementSystem.git
   cd HospitalManagementSystem
   ```

2. **Set up the database:**

   Create a MySQL database and the necessary tables. Here is an example script to set up the database:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE hospital;

   USE hospital;

   CREATE TABLE doctors (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       specialization VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
   );

   CREATE TABLE patients (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
       age INT NOT NULL,
       gender VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL
   );

   CREATE TABLE appointments (
       id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
       patient_id INT NOT NULL,
       doctor_id INT NOT NULL,
       appointment_date DATE NOT NULL,
       FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES patients(id),
       FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES doctors(id)
   );
   ```

3. **Configure the database connection:**

   Update the `HospitalManagementSystem.java` file with your database connection details.

   ```java
   private static final String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/hospital";
   private static final String username = "root";
   private static final String password = "yourpassword";
   ```

4. **Compile and run the project:**

   Use your IDE to compile and run the project. Ensure you have the MySQL JDBC driver in your classpath.

## Usage

Once the project is set up and running, you can interact with it through the console interface. The main menu offers the following options:

1. Add Patient
2. View Patients
3. View Doctors
4. Book Appointment
5. Exit

Follow the prompts to perform the desired actions.

### `Doctor.java`

This file contains the `Doctor` class, which manages doctor-related operations, including viewing all doctors.

### `Patient.java`

This file contains the `Patient` class, which manages patient-related operations, including adding new patients and viewing all patients.

### `HospitalManagementSystem.java`

This is the main class that contains the entry point of the application. It provides the console interface for interacting with the system and coordinates operations between the `Patient` and `Doctor` classes.
